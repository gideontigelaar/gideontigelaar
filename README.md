# Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Gideon!
I'm a 20-year-old software engineering student from the Netherlands, currently working as a PHP Developer at Dotsimpel. I'm particularly interested in web development and have been actively building my skills in this area.

My interest in software development began in 2015 when I dived into creating simple games in Unity3D. A few years later, I built my own Discord bot. That's when I realized that programming is my thing!

## Experienced with...
Languages, frameworks, software and more.
