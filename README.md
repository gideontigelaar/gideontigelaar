# Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Gideon!
I'm currently studying software development at Alfa-college in Groningen, the Netherlands. My particular interest lies in web development, and I'm actively building on my skills in this area.

My interest in software development began in 2015 when I dived into creating simple games in Unity3D. A few years later, I built my own Discord bot. That's when I realized that programming is my thing!

## Experienced with...
Languages, frameworks, software and more.
